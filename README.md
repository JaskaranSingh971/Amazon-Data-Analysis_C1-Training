# Amazon-Data-Analysis_C1-Training

1. Your goal will be to identify our most popular product. In order to do this, how should we define popular
(e.g., number of sales, number of product views, total revenue, etc.)?

2. Based on your chosen definition of popular, how can we find the popularity of each product? Describe the type of data
necessary for you to perform this calculation.

3. How can we focus our resources to increase production of our most popular product?
a. Hint: What resources (wood, aluminium, etc.) does our most popular product require to produce? How many of
these resources are being used for other products?

4. If we refocus our resources, how much will we be able to increase production?
a. Hint: If we use all of our resources for our most popular product, how much of our most popular product will we
be able to produce?

5. Optional Exercise for Part II: Once you calculate how many more of the most popular you can produce by diverting
resources in Part II, state whether it would be a good decision by the company to do so.

6. Optional Exercise for Part II: For an advanced exploration, ask your team - what is an industry where you think this problem
could actually arise? Search the internet (sites like Kaggle and Data.gov are great places to start to find a real-world dataset
to answer these questions with actual data. Paste a link to the specific dataset you choose here, then answer these questions
(or 2-3 similar questions, if relevant), which you can frame and answer in the same deliverable (see instructions below).
